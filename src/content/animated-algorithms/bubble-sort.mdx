title: Bubble Sort
description: Bubble sort compares all adjacent values in an array from beginning to end. If compared values are out of order it swaps them. It repeats the process until it goes through the entire array without doing any swaps. Then the array is sorted.

Bubble sort compares all adjacent values in an array from beginning to end. If compared values are out of order it swaps them. It repeats the process until it goes through the entire array without doing any swaps. Then the array is sorted.

You will not find Bubble Sort implemented in any real-world libraries because it is so inefficient. Its only upside is its simplicity to implement. Because of its simplicity it is used to teach the basics of sorting.
