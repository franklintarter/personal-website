I've been thinking about education lately, much of it inspired by the book [Mindstorms](http://worrydream.com/refs/Papert%20-%20Mindstorms%201st%20ed.pdf).

**Here's a hypothesis:**

We'd have better outcomes in math if programming were used to teach math.

After people learn to count, add, multiply, divide, and some really basic geometry like the area squares and rectangles, they should be taught basic programming. After basic programming then you can use programming to teach pre-algebra, algebra, and then everything that follows (also taught with programming).

It’s silly to teach something as abstract as algebra without teaching the reason why abstractions emerge from procedures. Programming is the perfect place to teach procedures and then why abstractions emerge from procedures. Once you have that you’re ready for algebra. Since you know programming you have a playground to learn algebra in as well.

### Procedures Are the Foundation

Procedures come first and we do teach procedures first. Counting is a procedure. So are adding, multiplying, finding the perimeter of a rectangle, etc.. It makes sense to teach some of these first.

But then things go off the rails. Rather than conceptualizing procedures as a first class idea, we move to the abstract formulas of pre-algebra and algebra. Many are lost in the jump from procedures, which are very concrete, to formulas, which are very abstract.

What if, instead, procedures themselves became the focus. Understanding why a procedure works, debugging procedures, comparing procedures. It could be argued that this is too much meta-thinking too early, but I think procedures are way more concrete than formulas. This is a step toward something more relatable and natural for a child.

Code does not have to be abstract at all. It can be very concrete and very procedural. A `for` loop maps perfectly to the idea of counting. Once programming and procedure creation/modification are part of the toolbox, abstraction emerges out of necessity and it feels natural.

Now math symbols and formulas have a reason for existing. The bridge from the concrete world of procedures and the abstract mathematical world is clearly programming. Once this is realized it's baffling that education tortures children with abstract symbols before they even know about creating or debugging a concrete procedure.

### Experimenting

I'm experimenting with this on myself. I'm trying to write math things I know and make procedural programming the bridge. [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) seem like a possible medium for this. At least it's one I don't have to build.

Here's an experimental try at a [notebook that explains Gauss's Formula](https://github.com/franklintarter/math-notebook/blob/main/Gauss.ipynb) with code and procedures. It's not aimed at children but for adults who know programming who might struggle with abstract math.
