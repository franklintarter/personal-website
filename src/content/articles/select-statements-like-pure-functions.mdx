title: Select Statements Like Pure Functions

Analogies are not perfectly accurate but they are perfectly useful. This is a pure function in JavaScript.

```js
function select(donuts) { // Take an array of donuts

    // Filter donuts into a new array based on the value of the price property
    const filteredDonuts = donuts.filter(d => d.price > 10)

    // Return another array of objects that only include the name and price
    return donuts.map(d => ({
        name: d.name,
        price: d.price
    })
}
```

This is a SQL select statement.

```sql
    SELECT -- Return a result-set that only includes name and price
    	Donuts.Name
    	, Donuts.Price

    FROM -- Take the donuts table
    	Donuts

    WHERE -- Filter the donuts based on the value of the price column
    	Donuts.Price > 10
```

All of the concepts from the JavaScript function map to this SQL statement. The syntax just switches the orders around.

SELECT is like RETURN.

FROM is like the INPUT.

WHERE is like the FILTER in the function body.

As we learn more we'll see that it doesn't always make sense to find an analogy from SQL to a non-database language. But we'll take the head start where we can.
